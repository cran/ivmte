\usage{
bound(g0, g1, sset, lpobj, obseq.factor, lpsolver, noisy = FALSE,
  debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g0}{set of expectations for each terms of the MTR for the
control group.}

\item{g1}{set of expectations for each terms of the MTR for the
control group.}

\item{sset}{a list containing the point estimates and gamma
components associated with each element in the S-set. This
object is only used to determine the names of terms. If it is
no submitted, then no names are provided to the solution
vector.}

\item{lpobj}{A list of matrices and vectors defining an LP problem.}

\item{obseq.factor}{overall multiplicative factor for how much more
the solution is permitted to violate observational equivalence
of the IV-like estimands, i.e. \code{obseq.factor} will
multiply \code{minobseq} directly.}

\item{lpsolver}{string, name of the package used to solve the LP
problem.}

\item{noisy}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} if optimization results
should be displayed.}

\item{debug}{boolean, indicates whether or not the function should
provide output when obtaining bounds. The option is only
applied when \code{lpsolver = 'gurobi'}. The output provided is
the same as what the Gurobi API would send to the console.}
}
\value{
a list containing the bounds on the treatment effect; the
    coefficients on each term in the MTR associated with the upper
    and lower bounds, for both counterfactuals; the optimization
    status to the maximization and minimization problems; the LP
    problem that the optimizer solved.
}
\description{
This function estimates the bounds on the target treatment effect.
