\title{Generate test distribution 1}
\usage{
gendist1(subN = 5, p1 = 0.4, p2 = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{subN}{integer, default set to 5. This is the number of
individuals possessing each value of the instrument. So the
total number of observations is subN * 2.}

\item{p1}{the probability of treatment for those with the
instrument Z = 1.}

\item{p2}{the probability of treatment for those with the
instrument Z = 2.}
}
\value{
a data.frame.
}
\description{
This function generates a data set for testing purposes. There is a
single instrument that takes on values of 1 or 2, and the
distribution of the values for the binary instrument is
uniform. The MTRs are m0 ~ 0 + u and m1 ~ 1 + u. All unobservables
u are integrated out.
