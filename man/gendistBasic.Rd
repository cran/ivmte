a list of two data.frame objects. One is the distribution
    of the simulated data, the other is the full simulated data
    set.

\description{
This code generates population level data to test the estimation
function. This is a simpler dataset, one in which we can more
easily estimate a correctly specified model.  The data presented
below will have already integrated over the # unobservable terms
U, where U | X, Z ~ Unif[0, 1].
