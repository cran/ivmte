\arguments{
\item{ivlike}{formula or vector of formulas used to specify the
regressions for the IV-like estimands.}

\item{data}{\code{data.frame} used to estimate the treatment
effects.}

\item{subset}{single subset condition or list of subset conditions
corresponding to each IV-like estimand. The input must be
logical. See \code{\link{l}} on how to input the argument. If
the user wishes to select specific rows, construct a binary
variable in the data set, and set the condition to use only
those observations for which the binary variable is 1, e.g. the
binary variable is \code{use}, and the subset condition is
\code{use == 1}.}

\item{components}{a list of vectors of the terms/components from
the regressions specifications we want to include in the set of
IV-like estimands. To select the intercept term, include in the
vector of variable names, `intercept'. See \code{\link{l}} on
how to input the argument. If no components for a IV
specification are given, then all components from that IV
specification will be included.}

\item{propensity}{formula or variable name corresponding to
propensity to take up treatment. If a formula is declared, then
the function estimates propensity score according to the
formula and link specified. If a variable name is declared,
then the corresponding column in the data is taken as the
vector of propensity scores.}

\item{link}{name of link function to estimate propensity score. Can
be chosen from \code{linear}, \code{probit}, or \code{logit}.}

\item{treat}{variable name for treatment indicator.}

\item{m0}{one-sided formula for marginal treatment response
function for control group. Splines can also be incorporated
using the expression "uSplines(degree, knots, intercept)". The
'intercept' argument may be omitted, and is set to \code{TRUE}
by default.}

\item{m1}{one-sided formula for marginal treatment response
function for treated group. Splines can also be incorporated
using the expression "uSplines(degree, knots, intercept)". The
'intercept' argument may be omitted, and is set to \code{TRUE}
by default.}

\code{m0} and \code{m1}.}

\code{m0}.}

\item{target}{target parameter to be estimated. Currently function
allows for ATE ("\code{ate}"), ATT ("\code{att}"), ATU
("\code{atu}"), LATE ("\code{late}"), and generalized LATE
("\code{genlate}").}

\item{target.weight0}{user-defined weight function for the control
group defining the target parameter. A list of functions can be
submitted if the weighting function is in fact a spline. The
arguments of the function should be variable names in
\code{data}. If the weight is constant across all observations,
then the user can instead submit the value of the weight
instead of a function.}

\item{target.weight1}{user-defined weight function for the treated
group defining the target parameter. A list of functions can be
submitted if the weighting function is in fact a spline. The

then the user can instead submit the value of the weight
instead of a function.}

\item{target.knots0}{user-defined set of functions defining the
knots associated with splines weights for the control
group. The arguments of the function should consist only of
variable names in \code{data}. If the knot is constant across
all observations, then the user can instead submit the value of
the weight instead of a function.}

\item{target.knots1}{user-defined set of functions defining the
knots associated with splines weights for the treated
group. The arguments of the function should be variable names
in \code{data}. If the knot is constant across all

estimating generalized LATE.}

equivalence. The threshold enters in multiplicatively. Thus, a
value of 0 corresponds to no violation of observational
equivalence other than statistical noise, and the assumption
that the model is correctly specified.}

1] of the unobservable u used to form the grid for imposing

group. By default, this will be set to the largest value of the

group. By default, this will be set to the smallest value of
the observed outcome in the estimation sample.}

\item{m0.lb}{numeric value for lower bound on MTR for control
group. By default, this will be set to the smallest value of

obtain the bounds on the treatment effect.}

\item{point}{boolean, default set to \code{FALSE}. Set to
\code{TRUE} if it is believed that the treatment effects are
point identified. If set to \code{TRUE}, then a FGLS procedure
is implemented to estimate the treatment effects. Shape
constraints on the MTRs will be ignored under point
identification.}

\item{point.itermax}{integer, default of 2. Maximum number of
iterations allowed for FGLS estimation under point
identification. So default estimate is the two-step FGLS.}

\item{point.tol}{scalar, set default at 1-e08. Tolerance for bounds
before automatically switchingto case of point
identification. So if the estimated bounds are narrower than
\code{point.tol}, and no shape restrictions are declared, the
function instead provides a point estimate of the treatment
effect. The output would be the same as if \code{point} was set
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{noisy}{boolean, default set to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE},
then messages are provided throughout the estimation
procedure. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress all messages,
e.g. when performing the bootstrap.}

\value{
Returns a list of results from throughout the estimation
    procedure. This includes all IV-like estimands; the propensity
    score model; bounds on the treatment effect; the estimated
    expectations of each term in the MTRs; the components and
    results of the LP problem.
}
\description{
This function estimates bounds on treatment effect parameters,
following the procedure described in Mogstad, Torgovitsky
(2017). Of the target parameters, the user can choose from the ATE,
ATT, ATU, LATE, and generalized LATE. The user is required to
provide a polynomial expression for the marginal treatment
responses (MTR), as well as a set of regressions. By restricting
the set of coefficients on each term of the MTRs to be consistent
with the regression estimates, the function is able to restrict
itself to a set of MTRs. The bounds on the treatment effect
parameter correspond to finding coefficients on the MTRs that
maximize their average difference.
}
\details{
The estimation procedure relies on the propensity to take up
treatment. The propensity scores can either be estimated as part of
the estimation procedure, or the user can specify a variable in the
data set already containing the propensity scores.

Constraints on the shape of the MTRs and marginal treatment effects
(MTE) can be imposed by the user, also. Specifically, bounds and
monotonicity restrictions are permitted. These constraints are only
enforced over a subset of the data. However, an audit procedure
randomly selects points outside of this subset to determine whether
or not the constraints hold. The user can specify how stringent
this audit procedure is using the function arguments.
