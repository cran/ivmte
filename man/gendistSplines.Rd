\title{Generate test data set with splines}
\usage{
gendistSplines()
}
\value{
a list of two data.frame objects. One is the distribution
    of the simulated data, the other is the full simulated data
    set.
}
\description{
This code generates population level data to test the
estimation function. This data set incorporates splines in the
MTRs.
}
\details{
The distribution of the data is as follows

       |     Z
 X/Z   |  0     1
_______|___________
    -1 | 0.1   0.1
       |
 X   0 | 0.2   0.2
       |
     1 | 0.1   0.2

The data presented below will have already integrated over the
unobservable terms U, and U | X, Z ~ Unif[0, 1].

The propensity scores are generated according to the model

p(x, z) = 0.5 - 0.1 * x + 0.2 * z

       |     Z
p(X,Z) |  0     1
_______|___________
    -1 | 0.6   0.8
       |
 X   0 | 0.5   0.7
       |
     1 | 0.4   0.6

The lowest common multiple of the first table is 12. The lowest
common multiple of the second table is 84. It turns out that 840 *
5 = 4200 observations is enough to generate the population data
set, such that each group has a whole-number of observations.

The MTRs are defined as follows:

y1 ~ beta0 + beta1 * x + uSpline(degree = 2,
                                knots  = c(0.3, 0.6),
                                intercept = FALSE)

The coefficients (beta1, beta2), and the coefficients on the
splines, will be defined below.

y0 = x : uSpline(degree = 0,
                 knots  = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8),
                 intercept = TRUE)
     + uSpline(degree = 1,
               knots  = c(0.4),
               intercept = TRUE)
     + beta3 * I(u ^ 2)

The coefficient beta3, and the coefficients on the splines, will be
defined below.
